# Open yours the most used weblinks fast in terminal
This little script allows you to open any number weblinks at one time.

It saves me a lot of time when running multiple links in browser at the same time. Also, when you work in the terminal, you
don't have to leave it to find and open the weblink you want.

## Installation
0. Clone this repository first
1. `cd web`
2. `pip3 install requirements.txt`
3. Next, I recommend you move the file to your home directory so that you can shorten the path to the file and run it quickly.
4. Specify links and their names in the file dictionary.
If all went well, you can run the file.

### Run ðŸš€
`python3 web.py app1 app2 app3`

If you write `python3 web.py showall` the script will show you all the urls you have entered in alphabetical order.
It makes it easier not to forget anything.

You will quickly feel the difference between opening weblinks using the GUI and using my script. With the script,
you can **open all the necessary weblinks at once** when you turn on your computer.

Of course, if you use the terminal as often as I do ðŸ™‚

# TODO 
- [ ] divide weblinks into different folders (dicts)
