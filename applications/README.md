# Open yours the most used applications fast in terminal
This little script allows you to open any number of computer applications at one time.

It saves me a lot of time when running multiple work programs at the same time. Also, when you work in the terminal, you
don't have to leave it to find and open the application you want.

## Installation
0. Clone this repository first  
1. `cd applications`
2. Next, I recommend you move the file to your home directory so that you can shorten the path to the file and run it quickly.
3. Depending on the location of the applications, specify the path every app in open.py file.

If all went well, you can run the file. 

### Run ðŸš€
`python3 open.py app1 app2 app3`

If you write `python3 open.py showall` the script will show you all the programs you have entered in alphabetical order.
It makes it easier not to forget anything.

You will quickly feel the difference between opening applications using the GUI and using my script. With the script, 
you can **open all the necessary applications at once** when you turn on your computer.  

Of course, if you use the terminal as often as I do ðŸ™‚
